                <p><em>"A Goliath-class machine lifeform modeled after an opera singer, this unit attacked foes using the repurposed bodies of living androids. Obsessed with a certain other machine lifeform, she put great thought into her appearance - even going so far as to cannibalize her own kind. Alas, such garish decorations only ended up being a spectacular display of poor taste. Her search for beauty eventually led to her demise when she attacked 2B and 9S."</em></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Simone has a wide array of attacks such as a wave of energy (similar to the Wave pod program).</li>
                <li>Getting within melee range forces Simone to reveal a hidden machine underneath her mechanical dress which performs melee attacks.</li>
                <li>Another common attack is her use of slow ring-like projectiles which infect the player, causing them to commit to a hacking puzzle to escape.</li>
                <li>Halfway through the encounter, Simone summons the bodies of near-death androids which also have the above-mentioned wave and ring attacks.</li>
                <li>The less health Simone has the more enraged she becomes, increasing the rate of her attacks.</li>
                <li>Many of her attacks are synchronized with specific parts of her boss theme.</li>

            <h3>Extra Info</h3>
            <p>Cutscenes during Route B reveal Simone was originally a Small Stubby, who over time cannibalized parts from other Machines to upgrade herself into her present form. Simone's actual head, still that of a stubby, is mounted on the clavacle area of her current body, with a false, eyeless larger head mounted above it.</p>

                <li>An extremely high powered combined variant of the previous multi-legged machines Ko-Shi and Ro-Shi.</li>
                <li>The player's perspective will constantly switch between A2 and 9S as they try to take on the massive Goliath-class unit. This effect increases rapidly as the battle progresses, forcing the player to concentrate on the location of both characters at once.</li>
                <li>The entire body of this unit is covered in electricity, which damages the player upon contact. However, it can be disabled after Ko-Shi & Ro-Shi uses a powerful attack, some of which are listed above.</li>

            <p>He is named after the Prussian philosopher Immanuel Kant.</p>
