            <h2>Simone</h2>
            <p><em>Unique, Can be found in the Amusement Park.</em></p>
        
            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>A Goliath-class machine lifeform modeled after an opera singer, this unit attacked foes using the repurposed bodies of living androids. Obsessed with a certain other machine lifeform, she put great thought into her appearance - even going so far as to cannibalize her own kind. Alas, such garish decorations only ended up being a spectacular display of poor taste. Her search for beauty eventually led to her demise when she attacked 2B and 9S.</p>
        
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simone has a wide array of attacks such as a wave of energy (similar to the Wave pod program).</li>
                <li>Getting within melee range forces Simone to reveal a hidden machine underneath her mechanical dress which performs melee attacks.</li>
                <li>Another common attack is her use of slow ring-like projectiles which infect the player, causing them to commit to a hacking puzzle to escape.</li>
                <li>Halfway through the encounter, Simone summons the bodies of near-death androids which also have the above-mentioned wave and ring attacks.</li>
                <li>The less health Simone has the more enraged she becomes, increasing the rate of her attacks.</li>
                <li>Many of her attacks are synchronized with specific parts of her boss theme.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Extra Info</h3>
            <p>Cutscenes during Route B reveal Simone was originally a Small Stubby, who over time cannibalized parts from other Machines to upgrade herself into her present form. Simone's actual head, still that of a stubby, is mounted on the clavacle area of her current body, with a false, eyeless larger head mounted above it.</p>
        
        

            <img src="images/Ko-Shi-Ro-Shi.jpg" id='Ko-Shi-Ro-Shi'>
            <h2>Ko-Shi & Ro-Shi</h2>
            <p><em>Unique, Can be found in the Tower.</em></p>
        
            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>A machine lifeform formed by combining two multi-legged, Goliath-class units. Former leg sections of combined units have been repurposed into a pair of powerful arms making it capable of rolling out powerful attacks from both close and long range.</p>
        
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This unit is encountered during 17-07.</li>
                <li>An extremely high powered combined variant of the previous multi-legged machines Ko-Shi and Ro-Shi.</li>
                <li>The player's perspective will constantly switch between A2 and 9S as they try to take on the massive Goliath-class unit. This effect increases rapidly as the battle progresses, forcing the player to concentrate on the location of both characters at once.</li>
                <li>The entire body of this unit is covered in electricity, which damages the player upon contact. However, it can be disabled after Ko-Shi & Ro-Shi uses a powerful attack, some of which are listed above.</li>
            </ul>


            <img src="images/immanuel.jpg" id='immanuel'>
            <h2>Immanuel</h2>
            <p><em>Unique, Can be found in Forest Zone.</em></p>
        
            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>"Immanuel was manufactured in the year 11,817 after the first Forest King, Ernst, passed away. It spoke its first words in 11,937."</p>
        
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This small machine lifeform—known as the Forest King—was destroyed following the sudden appearance of A2.</li>
                <li>Once the Forest King is killed by A2 during the events in the main story, almost all Forest Kingdom Machines become hostile, preparing ambushes in order to eliminate the castle intruders.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Extra Info</h3>
            <p>He is named after the Prussian philosopher Immanuel Kant.</p>



            <img src="images/friedrich.jpg" id='friedrich'>
            <h2>Friedrich</h2>
            <p><em>Unique, Can be found in Abandoned Factory.</em></p>
        
            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>""A "little brother" machine lifeform that desperately poured oil into a machine he called his sibling.

                In the heat of battle, this unit begged for his brother's life to be spared—only to see him cut down without mercy." (if A2 kills Auguste)
                
                "…—a request A2 granted for unknown reasons." (if A2 leaves)
                — In-Game Data"</p>
        
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This machine life form is playable at the start of route B.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Extra Info</h3>
            <p>He is probably named after either Friedrich Nietzsche or Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel. The latter is usually cited as "Friedrich Schlegel" and had a brother named August.</p>
